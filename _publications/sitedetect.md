Abstract:
Modeling site-specific effects using observed data is a critical component in
understanding the results of multisite trials. A standard approach leveraging
Bayesian methods is to rely on Gaussian distributional assumptions and to use
the posterior means (PM) of the random effects. The standard approach can be
misleading, however, in the estimation of individual site-specific effects and their
empirical distribution and ranks. In this chapter, we review the following two
strategies developed to improve inferences regarding site-specific effects: (a)
relaxing the normality assumption by flexible modeling of the random-effects
distribution using Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models, and (b) replacing the
choice of PM as the summary of the posterior by alternative estimators, such as
the constrained Bayes (CB) or the triple-goal (GR) estimators. We then examine
when and to what extent the two strategies and combinations thereof work or fail
under varying conditions. We found that the informativeness of the data is the
most influential factor for all inferential goals and determines the effects of other
factors. When the data are uninformative, specifying a flexible DPM model is not
in general an effective strategy compared to a Gaussian model. A simple
parametric model combined with a posterior summary method targeted toward
an inferential goal performs better under the uninformative data environment.
When data is informative, however, DPM models tend to outperform a Gaussian
model particularly in estimating percentiles of the underlying distribution.
