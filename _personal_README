ISSUES WITH INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS (resolved)
 
Current issues: tried following https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/
 - Install of ruby 31 with devkit seems to work fine
 - gem install bundler works fine
 - bundle install breaks (can't install a bunch of packages)
I've tried:
 - launching the SYS application after installing ruby with devkit
 - using 'bundle clean' before bundle install

TODO: try https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages
 - Note: need to run command prompt and git bash as administrator
 - Note: need to manually install MSYS2 https://www.msys2.org/#installation
Currently: can install jekyll, and bundle install works fine
 - Issue: https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo/wiki/Resolving-TZInfo::DataSourceNotFound-Errors
 - Weird... tzinfo-data gem is installed, but can't seem to find it?
 - STUCK HERE for now

TODO: potential issue, I accidentally installed things as admin and this is bad? (https://makandracards.com/makandra/1667-how-to-fix-gems-are-unavailable-although-they-are-installed)
 - Might need to uninstall and retry?
 - https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/issues/1767

Removing the version specifications in the tzinfo-data line in the gemfile worked to some extent, new error now lol
 - Need to install webrick https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/8523
 - ...and it works now!
