I'm an applied statistician with experience in A/B testing and advanced modeling (Bayesian modeling, machine learning).
My research interests include causal inference and applied Bayesian methods for the social sciences and sports.
I received my PhD in statistics from Harvard University in 2023 and my BA in statistics and mathematics from Amherst College in 2018.
